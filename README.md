# Delhi Metro

## Overview
This project is a **C++ implementation** of the **Delhi Metro** system, focusing on route planning and fare calculation. The program helps users find the shortest path between metro stations and provides estimated travel costs.

## Features
- 📍 **Station Details** – Get information about metro stations.
- 🚇 **Shortest Path Finder** – Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient route.
- 💰 **Fare Calculator** – Estimates travel fare based on metro policies.
- ⏳ **Travel Time Estimator** – Calculates estimated travel duration between stations.

## Installation
Clone the repository using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Abhi95081/Delhi-Metro.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd Delhi-Metro
```
Compile the C++ program:
```sh
g++ Delhi_metro.cpp -o delhi_metro
```

## Usage
Run the executable:
```sh
./delhi_metro
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to input your starting and destination stations.

## Algorithm Used
This project uses **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to determine the shortest path between metro stations. The algorithm efficiently finds the optimal route based on predefined metro connections and distances.
